# Backpropagation-Classification-DL
I developed a backpropagation algorithm from scratch to classify whether a student will be placed in a job on a small dataset. This Algorithm includes forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation for weight updates. This custom-built algorithm was compared to keras in built library in terms of performance and efficiency.
